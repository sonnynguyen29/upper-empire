Gold aglets on the laces added a luxurious touch, while hieroglyphic-inspired details gave it a vibe straight out of ancient Egypt, as if King Tut himself shopped for sneakers in space. This wasn’t just a colorway; it was a revolution.<br/></p>"

But for the bold few who choose to wear them, they’re surprisingly comfortable for their era. The Phylon midsole and Air heel unit provide ample cushioning, and the midfoot strap keeps your foot secure like a vault lock. They run snug, so sizing up half a size is recommended. Just be aware—older pairs age like bananas, not wine. The midsoles deteriorate quickly, so handle with care.<br/></p>"
