Ventilation ports keep the silhouette light and breathable, and an upper comprised of synthetic leather and mesh TecTuff provides a layered look that’s built to last. The introduction of new statement colors and neutral hues to the Vomero 5 lineup provides even more styling options.The Vomero 5 kids’ model, introduced this fall, incorporates subtle design changes for a kid-right fit, such as a more durable rubber outsole material, an upgraded sock liner and pull tabs that make it easier to put on the shoe.</p>"

It gives this retro vibe,” says Nike athlete and UConn guard Paige Bueckers. “A lot of the shoes that I’ve been wearing since I was little have the same look and feel, so it gives me something different. I love the colorways, I love the feel, I love the look.”<br/>The Vomero Roam is the latest weatherized addition to the Nike Roam collection of functional, simple and stylish silhouettes engineered to hold up against the rigors of all seasons.<br/>The shoe is designed for form and function, with bold tooling complementing a simplistic upper and a stacked heel delivering expressive traction. Clean and smooth-coated leathers are treated with water-resistant textile finishes, and thermal linings and closed seams provide low-bulk warming benefits. Versatile colorways anchor the Vomero Roam lineup, while strategic pops of color add a contemporary edge.</p>"
